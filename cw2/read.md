A lower perplexity generally indicates a better language model. However, the ideal perplexity value depends on various factors like the dataset, model architecture, and the specific task.   

Here's a general guideline:

- Perplexity of 1: This is the ideal score, indicating that the model predicts the next word perfectly every time. This is rarely achievable in practice.   
- Perplexity between 1 and 10: This is considered a good range for many language modeling tasks.
- Perplexity above 10: This indicates that the model is struggling to predict the next word accurately.   
It's important to note that p
